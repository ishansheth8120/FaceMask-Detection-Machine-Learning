This is a Java program that retrieves data from a SQL Server database, processes it, and inserts it into a MongoDB collection. Let me go over the different parts of the code:

1. Connection to MongoDB: The code establishes a connection to a MongoDB instance using the MongoClient class, providing the user credentials, the database name, the host, and the port number.

2. Collection initialization: The code initializes a MongoDB collection called "ETFSOLA_Resp" and then drops any existing data in the collection using the drop() method.

3. Connection to SQL Server: The code establishes a connection to a SQL Server instance using the DriverManager class and provides the URL, username, and password.

4. SQL query: The code retrieves data from a SQL Server table called "TBL_ETFPOSITIONS" that meets certain criteria.

5. Processing data: The retrieved data is processed in batches. Each batch of data is processed in a separate thread using the ExecutorService class.

6. MongoDB document creation: After processing, the data is converted to a JSON object and then to a MongoDB document using the Document.parse() method.

7. Insertion of data into MongoDB: The document is then inserted into the MongoDB collection using the insertOne() method. Alternatively, the document can be inserted in bulk using the bulkWrite() method.

Overall, this code is a simple example of how to transfer data from a SQL Server database to a MongoDB collection using Java.





Sure, here are the bulleted points to explain the provided code:

Main method:
- Declares and initializes variables for MongoDB connection parameters.
- Creates a list of server addresses for MongoDB connection.
- Creates a MongoCredential object with the provided username, password, and database name.
- Creates a MongoClient object with the server addresses and credential.
- Gets the MongoDB database with the provided database name.
- Drops a MongoDB collection named "ETFSOLA_Resp".
- Declares and initializes variables for SQL Server connection parameters.
- Creates a JsonObject to store the combined ETF data.
- Constructs an SQL query to retrieve distinct security IDs and ASAT dates from a table named "MIDAS.TBL_ETFPOSITIONS".
- Initializes lists to store retrieved security IDs and ASAT dates.
- Creates a database connection with the provided SQL Server URL, username, and password.
- Executes the SQL query to retrieve security IDs and ASAT dates and stores them in their respective lists.
- Sets the number of threads and batch size for processing the retrieved security IDs.
- Creates a fixed thread pool executor service.
- Divides the security IDs and ASAT dates into batches and submits them to the executor service for processing.
- Shuts down the executor service and waits for all threads to finish.
- Catches and throws exceptions if any occur.

RetrieveETFFromMongo method:
- Gets all documents from a MongoDB collection named "ETFSOLA_Resp".

processBatch method:
- Accepts lists of security IDs, ASAT dates, and a database connection object as parameters.
- Initializes variables to store ETF data.
- Constructs an SQL query to retrieve ETF data from tables named "MIDAS.TBL_ETF" and "MIDAS.TBL_ETFPOSITIONS".
- Executes the SQL queries and stores the retrieved data in their respective JSON objects.
- Converts the JSON objects to JSON strings.
- Creates a JsonObject to store the combined ETF data and adds the JSON strings to it.
- Parses the JsonObject to a MongoDB Document object.
- Creates a list of InsertOneModel objects with the Document.
- Inserts the Document and bulk writes the InsertOneModel objects to the MongoDB collection.
- Calculates the execution time for processing and retrieving data from MongoDB.


Sure, here are the pointers as problem statements:

1. Statistics and enhancing multithreading:
- Generate statistics for data retrieval from SQL server and insertion into MongoDB
- Collect data size statistics for data being processed
- Generate stats on different methods and threads to analyze performance
- Enhance multithreading to improve performance

2. Inserting data on multiple dates:
- Modify the code to allow inserting records on multiple dates
- Ensure that records are inserted accurately based on the specified date

3. Querying in MongoDB like SQL:
- Convert SQL statements into MongoDB queries for data retrieval
- Ensure that the converted queries work correctly and efficiently

4. Data fetching based on dates:
- Modify the code to allow fetching data based on dates
- Ensure that the retrieved data is accurate and complete

5. Overwriting updated data:
- Check if the data has been updated by the vendor based on timestamps
- Overwrite the data in MongoDB if the data is updated on the same date
