This is a Java program that retrieves data from a SQL Server database, processes it, and inserts it into a MongoDB collection. Let me go over the different parts of the code:

1. Connection to MongoDB: The code establishes a connection to a MongoDB instance using the MongoClient class, providing the user credentials, the database name, the host, and the port number.

2. Collection initialization: The code initializes a MongoDB collection called "ETFSOLA_Resp" and then drops any existing data in the collection using the drop() method.

3. Connection to SQL Server: The code establishes a connection to a SQL Server instance using the DriverManager class and provides the URL, username, and password.

4. SQL query: The code retrieves data from a SQL Server table called "TBL_ETFPOSITIONS" that meets certain criteria.

5. Processing data: The retrieved data is processed in batches. Each batch of data is processed in a separate thread using the ExecutorService class.

6. MongoDB document creation: After processing, the data is converted to a JSON object and then to a MongoDB document using the Document.parse() method.

7. Insertion of data into MongoDB: The document is then inserted into the MongoDB collection using the insertOne() method. Alternatively, the document can be inserted in bulk using the bulkWrite() method.

Overall, this code is a simple example of how to transfer data from a SQL Server database to a MongoDB collection using Java.



Main method:
- Declares and initializes variables for MongoDB connection parameters.
- Creates a list of server addresses for MongoDB connection.
- Creates a MongoCredential object with the provided username, password, and database name.
- Creates a MongoClient object with the server addresses and credential.
- Gets the MongoDB database with the provided database name.
- Drops a MongoDB collection named "ETFSOLA_Resp".
- Declares and initializes variables for SQL Server connection parameters.
- Creates a JsonObject to store the combined ETF data.
- Constructs an SQL query to retrieve distinct security IDs and ASAT dates from a table named "MIDAS.TBL_ETFPOSITIONS".
- Initializes lists to store retrieved security IDs and ASAT dates.
- Creates a database connection with the provided SQL Server URL, username, and password.
- Executes the SQL query to retrieve security IDs and ASAT dates and stores them in their respective lists.
- Sets the number of threads and batch size for processing the retrieved security IDs.
- Creates a fixed thread pool executor service.
- Divides the security IDs and ASAT dates into batches and submits them to the executor service for processing.
- Shuts down the executor service and waits for all threads to finish.
- Catches and throws exceptions if any occur.

RetrieveETFFromMongo method:
- Gets all documents from a MongoDB collection named "ETFSOLA_Resp".

processBatch method:
- Accepts lists of security IDs, ASAT dates, and a database connection object as parameters.
- Initializes variables to store ETF data.
- Constructs an SQL query to retrieve ETF data from tables named "MIDAS.TBL_ETF" and "MIDAS.TBL_ETFPOSITIONS".
- Executes the SQL queries and stores the retrieved data in their respective JSON objects.
- Converts the JSON objects to JSON strings.
- Creates a JsonObject to store the combined ETF data and adds the JSON strings to it.
- Parses the JsonObject to a MongoDB Document object.
- Creates a list of InsertOneModel objects with the Document.
- Inserts the Document and bulk writes the InsertOneModel objects to the MongoDB collection.
- Calculates the execution time for processing and retrieving data from MongoDB.


Sure, here are the pointers as problem statements:

1. Statistics and enhancing multithreading:
- Generate statistics for data retrieval from SQL server and insertion into MongoDB
- Collect data size statistics for data being processed
- Generate stats on different methods and threads to analyze performance
- Enhance multithreading to improve performance

2. Inserting data on multiple dates:
- Modify the code to allow inserting records on multiple dates
- Ensure that records are inserted accurately based on the specified date

3. Querying in MongoDB like SQL:
- Convert SQL statements into MongoDB queries for data retrieval
- Ensure that the converted queries work correctly and efficiently

4. Data fetching based on dates:
- Modify the code to allow fetching data based on dates
- Ensure that the retrieved data is accurate and complete

5. Overwriting updated data:
- Check if the data has been updated by the vendor based on timestamps
- Overwrite the data in MongoDB if the data is updated on the same date


1. Statistics and enhancing multithreading:
- As this code performs multiple operations such as data retrieval from SQL Server, insertion into MongoDB, and data size calculation, it would be helpful to generate statistics on different parts of the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
- To achieve this, we can add counters to measure the number of records processed and the time taken for each operation. We can also measure the data size to identify the impact of the data on the system.
- Additionally, we can implement multithreading to improve performance by processing multiple records simultaneously. However, we need to ensure that there are no race conditions or data inconsistencies due to concurrent access to the same data. 

2. Inserting data on multiple dates:
- Currently, the code inserts data into MongoDB for a single asatDate. However, financial institutions may need to load data for multiple asatDates.
- To support this, we can modify the code to accept a list of asatDates and insert data for each date.
- Additionally, we need to consider the impact of inserting a large volume of data for multiple dates on the performance of the system.

3. Querying in MongoDB just like we do in SQL:
- As the code migrates index data from SQL to MongoDB, it might be useful to convert SQL statements into MongoDB queries to simplify the migration process.
- To implement this, we can identify the equivalent MongoDB query for each SQL statement and use it to query data in MongoDB.
- However, we need to ensure that the MongoDB queries return the same results as the SQL queries to ensure the accuracy of the migrated data.

4. Data fetching based on dates:
- The code retrieves data from SQL Server based on a specific date range. However, financial institutions may need to retrieve data for a specific date.
- To implement this, we can modify the code to accept a specific date and retrieve data for that date only.
- Additionally, we need to consider the impact of retrieving a large volume of data for a specific date on the performance of the system.

5. Updating data from vendor side based on timestamps:
- Currently, the code inserts data into MongoDB without checking for existing data. However, vendors may update data based on timestamps, and we need to overwrite the existing data with the updated data.
- To implement this, we can check for existing data with the same timestamp and overwrite it with the updated data. 
- Additionally, we need to ensure that the overwritten data does not affect any ongoing operations or cause any inconsistencies in the system.


SELECT *
FROM MIDAS.TBL_ETF e
JOIN (
    SELECT SECURITYID, MAX(ASATDATE) AS ASATDATE
    FROM MIDAS.TBL_ETF
    WHERE SECURITYID = ?
    GROUP BY SECURITYID
) t ON e.SECURITYID = t.SECURITYID AND e.ASATDATE = t.ASATDATE
