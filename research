Abstract
The financial sector is highly reliant on technology and data-driven systems, making it vulnerable to failures and disruptions. The failure of any banking system can result in significant financial loss, customer dissatisfaction, and even reputational damage. This research paper explores the use of predictive maintenance using machine learning algorithms to identify potential failures in banking systems before they occur. The paper also discusses the types of failures, handling failures, and use of neural networks as a machine learning algorithm that can be used for predictive maintenance in banking. This research explores the use of log data generated from applications to predict failures before they occur. Specifically, the study focuses on the use of Splunk, a tool that collects and indexes log data from various sources, to integrate machine learning models for early failure prediction. The study proposes a workflow that includes preprocessing the log data, training the machine learning model, and deploying the model to generate alerts in real-time.


Introduction
The banking industry has been using technology to optimize its services, improve operational efficiency and minimize costs. However, with the increasing use of technology, banking systems have become more complex, and their failure can have severe consequences. Therefore, it is crucial for banks to maintain their systems regularly and identify potential failures before they occur so as to take necessary steps beforehand. The use of machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance can help banks mitigate the risks of system failures and prevent downtime. Overall, this research highlights the potential of using log data and machine learning for early failure prediction in banking and provides a solution by implementing such a system using Splunk.


Literature Review
AI in Banking
AI has the potential to transform the banking industry, and predicting failures is one of the areas where it has shown promise. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, including structured and unstructured data, to identify patterns and relationships that are not visible to human analysts. This can help banks to detect potential risks and take action before they become crises. There are several AI techniques that can be used for failure prediction, including machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze historical data and identify patterns that are indicative of potential failures. These algorithms can be trained on data from past banking failures, and then used to predict the likelihood of future failures. Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to analyze news articles, social media, and other sources of unstructured data to identify potential risks. Deep learning algorithms can be used to analyze complex data sets, such as images and audio, to detect potential risks.



Methodology:
Handling Failures 
Error Handling mechanism: after failure
Rule-based algorithm: can be added to reduce dependencies in tasks
Monitoring and reporting: notifications and alerts
Disaster recovery plan

But as is clear from the current situation, all these methods for handling failures are used only after the failure has already occurred, which causes downtime. There must be a system in place to foresee failures before they occur in order to prevent this.

Predicting Failures
Failures can be predicted in a banking environment by keeping an eye on and analyzing various system parameters and performance metrics. Some methods to predict - 

Trend Analysis: Analysing historical data regarding failures, errors and system crashes to identify patterns. ML algorithms can be trained to identify patterns in the dtaa and make predictions about the likelihood of future failures.

Resource Utilisation monitoring:  Research utilization and monitoring can play a crucial role in analyzing failure by providing insights and identifying patterns.

Error Logging:  Keeping track of error logs and analyzing them can provide insights into the root cause of failures and help predict future failures. 
User behavior analysis: By analyzing user behavior, such as the number of concurrent users, the frequency of tasks, and the time of day (including different timezones), it is possible potential bottlenecks and predict failures.  It can also help in identifying specific user activities or workflows that are causing issues or errors in the system, allowing for targeted improvements and optimizations.


Performance monitoring: Performance monitoring tools like Splunk, Grafana, etc can be used to monitor the response times of tasks and the overall performance of the system, providing an early warning of potential failures. 

Error Logs 
Error logs record error conditions encountered by computer software during runtime. They provide information on what happened, when it happened, and the criticality of the error. Application error logs are particularly useful for troubleshooting outages and performance issues. They can also be used for traditional monitoring and security information management systems.

Error logging can be helpful for early failure prediction using machine learning in several ways:

Identifying Patterns: By analyzing error logs, we can identify patterns that could indicate an impending failure. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize these patterns and alert system administrators before a failure occurs.

Root Cause Analysis: Error logs can provide valuable insights into the root cause of a failure. By analyzing the error logs, machine learning models can identify the root cause of a failure and provide recommendations for fixing the issue before it occurs again.

Proactive Maintenance: By analyzing error logs and predicting potential failures, banks can proactively perform maintenance on their systems, reducing the likelihood of system downtime and increasing overall system reliability.

Error logging can provide a wealth of information that can be used to train machine learning models to predict failures before they occur, enabling banks to take proactive measures to prevent system downtime and improve overall system reliability.

Neural Networks

Neural networks can be applied to solve this problem. Neural networks are a type of deep learning algorithm that can learn to recognize patterns and relationships in data. In the case of predicting failures, a neural network could be trained on log data (typically error logs) to learn what patterns of log data are indicative of an impending failure.

There are different types of neural networks that can be applied to this problem, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). RNNs are good for handling sequential data, which is useful for log data as it is often generated over time. CNNs, on the other hand, are good for handling spatial data, which could be useful for log data that has a spatial component, such as logs from multiple servers in a distributed system.

Once trained, the neural network can be used to predict failures based on new log data. If the network recognizes a pattern in the log data that is similar to patterns it has seen before that led to a failure, it could raise an alert or take other actions to prevent the failure from occurring.


Splunk 
Splunk is a software platform used for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data in real-time. It can ingest data from a wide range of sources, including application logs, network traffic, sensors, clickstreams, and social media. Splunk processes and indexes the data, enabling users to search, monitor, and analyze it using a web-based interface. The platform offers a variety of features, including dashboards, alerts, machine learning, and data visualization tools. 

Splunk provides facilities for early failure prediction through its machine learning capabilities. Splunk's machine learning toolkit can be used to build predictive models using historical data to detect anomalies and predict failures before they occur. The toolkit provides a user-friendly interface to develop and deploy ML based models on data ingested into Splunk. The toolkit includes algorithms such as regression, clustering, and classification, which can be used to analyze and correlate data to train and test a neural network model by collecting and analyzing data from various sources such as log files, network traffic, and system metrics. 

The neural network model can then be used to predict potential failures in the system based on the analyzed data. Additionally, the model can also be able to generate alerts or trigger automated actions, helping organizations proactively address potential issues before they become critical.

Furthermore, Splunk's real-time analytics and visualization capabilities enable organizations to monitor and investigate system behavior in real-time, further enhancing their ability to detect and prevent failures.

By combining the power of Splunk's data collection and analysis capabilities with the predictive power of neural networks, investment banks can have a more accurate and timely prediction of potential system failures, allowing them to take proactive measures to prevent these failures from happening.


Putting into practice
The primary steps to make all this work for early failure prediction in banking systems could be:-

Collect and aggregate relevant data: Collect and aggregate log data from various systems, applications, and devices using Splunk. The data can be collected in real-time or near real-time.

Preprocess data: Preprocess the data to clean and transform it to make it suitable for input to the neural network. This may include data cleansing, data normalization, and data formatting. Data mapping, a process of mapping log data to a format that is suitable for ML algorithms to consume involving mapping log data to a code or numerical representation that can be more easily processed by the model.

Train a neural network model: Develop and train a neural network model that can predict system failures based on the preprocessed data. This can involve selecting the appropriate neural network architecture, defining the input and output layers, and selecting the training algorithm. When the model is trained on historical log data, it learns patterns and anomalies that are indicative of potential failures. The trained model can later be applied to new, unseen log data to detect similar patterns and anomalies.

Integrate Splunk with the neural network model: Integrate Splunk with the neural network model using custom code or third-party libraries that can take the preprocessed data as input and use the trained neural network model to generate predictions.

Deploy the integrated solution: Deploy the integrated solution in a production environment, where it can collect data, preprocess it, generate predictions, and alert system administrators or other stakeholders of potential failures.

Monitor and refine the solution: Continuously monitor the performance of the integrated solution, refine the neural network model based on new data and feedback, and make improvements to the integration as needed.

As and when the model is successfully deployed in the production environment, Splunk’s internal API can be used to fetch log data. In a production environment, Splunk can be integrated into the logging pipeline to automatically collect logs from various sources such as servers, applications, and network devices. This can be achieved by installing the Splunk Forwarder on the sources, which then sends the logs to a central Splunk Indexer. The indexer stores and indexes the data, making it searchable and available for analysis.


Fig: Sample Illustration

To apply the created model to the collected logs which is our unseen data, a data pipeline can be created in Splunk that includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The collected logs gets converted into the format that our model was trained with. Thus, preprocessing step can involve data cleaning, normalization, and mapping to a common format. Feature extraction can involve identifying relevant features from the log data such as error messages, timestamps, and source addresses.

If the model detects patterns and anomalies that are indicative of a potential failure as per our training data, it can generate an alert or trigger an action. The exact criteria for generating an alert will depend on the specific model and the use case. For example, the model may be configured to generate an alert if it detects a certain number of instances of a specific type of error within a specific time window.

For instance, consider these examples for alerts:-

Alert for high CPU Utilization - which could indicate a performance issue that may lead to a system failure.

Alert for unusual network traffic - which could indicate a security breach or other network-related issue that may lead to a system failure.

Alert for disk space usage - which could indicate that the system is running out of disk space and may fail soon if not addressed.

Alert for application errors - which could indicate a problem with the application that may lead to a system failure.


These alerts may be triggered if the ML model detects a pattern of any aforementioned alert  in the log data, which could indicate a problem with that component that may lead to a system failure.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the proposed solution of  the Proactive fault tolerance is an essential aspect of modern banking systems, as it can enable financial institutions to predict and prevent system failures before they occur. The use of AI-driven approaches for failure prediction using Splunk logs can significantly enhance proactive fault tolerance capabilities. With Splunk's ability to collect and analyze massive amounts of log data in real-time, coupled with the power of machine learning algorithms like neural network, banks can proactively identify and resolve potential failures. By combining these technologies, banks can effectively minimize downtime and maintain high availability, ensuring their customers receive uninterrupted services.
